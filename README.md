## General Information
- Super short game made in 2 weeks using Unity and some assets for music and SFX.
- Since I made it in a rush, a lot of things are badly done or could be better, there's also a problem with performance on Mobile caused by Text Object instantiation/deactivation that needs to be reworked.
- The purpose of this project is to hopefully make this game look and feel a little more profesional with the things I've learnt since it's release and now.
- I originally made the game because I wanted to expand on the activities we (a non profit japanese culture organization) had to celebrate Kodomo No Hi(Children's Day).
